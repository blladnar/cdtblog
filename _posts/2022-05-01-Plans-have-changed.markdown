Sleeping on a train is a lot nicer than sleeping on a plane. There’s more leg room, the seat folds down more, and there’s even a foot rest that pulls out. If you rent a sleeper car, it’s even better because you have a bed!

Despite my “luxurious” seat, I didn’t actually sleep all that well. It was more like a series of 30 minute naps than a long sleep. Either way, the night passed pretty quickly and before I knew it, it was time for breakfast.

Breakfast was the only meal I hadn’t had on the train so I went with the Amtrak Signature French Toast. It turned out pretty good. The sausage especially.

After breakfast I took some more naps and got some bad news. My train to New Mexico was canceled! Apparently a fire near Palm Springs had burned a rail bridge that I would need to go over. That meant I had to scramble to find a new way to Lordsburg so I can catch my shuttle on May 5th. Luckily there were a few Greyhound busses leaving the next day.

I opted for an evening bus that will get me to Lordsburg at 9 am on the 3rd. That will give me a whole day in LA to hang out. I hopped on HotelTonight and got a pretty nice hotel downtown. 

With my plans made, I was able to relax and enjoy the views.

This was just outside of San Luis Obispo. Soon after that we followed the coast and drove past the Vandenberg Space Force base where I saw a SpaceX hangar and lots of great ocean views.

In Santa Barbara some middle aged drunk women got on and caused a bit of a scene while they tried to find the bar car to get more wine. That was pretty entertaining. They got off the train at the next stop in Oxnard.

Finally I made it to LA and despite my worries, the train was actually early. I walked to my hotel and, just like the last time I was in LA, I was struck by how many parking lots there are. It’s very noticeable.

Even though it would have been nice to be on the train to New Mexico right now, I’m pretty thankful I get to sleep in a real bed tonight. Tomorrow I’ll be sleeping on a bus…
