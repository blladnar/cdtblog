After last night’s rodeo shenanigans a good night of sleep was awesome. We all still woke up pretty early and went to the one place in town open for breakfast.

One thing that’s nice about small towns is everything is usually close by. Our hotel was close to some restaurants and after checking out we went to grab lunch. You could tell we were all stalling a bit, but we did start trying to hitch out around 1 pm.

We had a bit of trouble getting a ride so we recruited one of the girl hikers in town to try and get someone to pull over. It actually worked and we had a ride about 10 minutes later.

I guess technically I was done with Montana the other day, but I took a photo with the last “Welcome to Montana” we’ll see.

I hiked with Pitch and Raider for the first time today. After seeing them regularly in towns for the last few months I stayed and hiked with them. It was really fun and we saw lots of other hikers today that I mostly just see in towns too.

We were talking so much on the hike I barely took any photos. It was a good way to pass the time and it made the afternoon fly by. We still got about 15 miles in, even with the late start. That puts us in a great position to get to Anaconda in a few days.

I think I left my headphones in our hotel room because I can’t find them. I should be able to get some new ones in the next town, but now I won’t really be able to watch Netflix at night without bothering anyone else for a few days. What a tragedy!
