As the sun rose and the roosters crowed, everyone started to get up. Where I slept on the floor got the first sun and I was ready to go.

Today was filled with laundry, food, post office, food, groceries, and more food.

I really wanted to hike out today, but didnâ€™t really want to do it alone. Looks like the weather is gonna be rough for a few days too.
