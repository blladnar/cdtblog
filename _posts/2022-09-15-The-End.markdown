I woke up after a cold wet night ready to hike the last 14 miles to the border. I couldn’t believe it was really the end.

The trail passed through forest roads and cow pastures. I saw a few people, one man with horses who only spoke Spanish, one bike packer, and one southbound hiker. It was cold enough last night that some of the hail that fell hadn’t melted, making it look a little bit like it snowed.

I was checking my progress often, eager to get to the border and right around noon I made it! I was lucky and the sun came out just long enough for me to celebrate.

It was an emotional moment and I’d be lying if I told you I didn’t shed a few tears. I had some cell phone service so I texted a few people to let them know I was done before making my way the 3 miles to the road.

There wasn’t much traffic on the highway, but my ride into town didn’t take too long. I checked into my hotel room and headed over to the one restaurant in town that was open.

There was a southbound hiker and we spent some time talking with tourists and locals about our hike. It was a really nice way to celebrate finishing the trail!
