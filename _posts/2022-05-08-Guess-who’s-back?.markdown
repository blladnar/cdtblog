This trail has been hard. It’s hot, the views have been few and far between, and sharing water with cows kinda sucks.

Today wasn’t so different. After eighty-some miles, we were finally back where we (sorta) started. Lordsburg, New Mexico. After arriving last week, one of the last things I wanted to was spend another night here.

Unfortunately, the heat, the blisters on my feet, and my new friends had me renting a room at the Motel 6. Since it’s a Sunday, not much in town was open. The main restaurant was closed and the grocery store was closing early. After our first stop (McDonald’s) we checked to see if our room was ready. It was, and we all went to take showers.

After showering, we met up and resupplied at the one grocery store in town. We only have 3 days to the next town and I think I have too much food.

With several more hours of daylight, we headed back to the rooms to hang out and play cards. We did laundry and met another hiker. 

As dinner approached we realized we were light on options. McDonald’s and a Mexican restaurant were our only choices. We opted for Mexican and also found a few beers in the hiker box next door at the Econolodge. Now I can say I’ve been to every restaurant in Lordsburg. (At leas all of them that are “downtown”)

It’s gonna be another early morning to beat the heat, so now it’s time for bed.
