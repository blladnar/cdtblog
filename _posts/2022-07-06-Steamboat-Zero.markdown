This was the first zero day in a pretty long time and Steamboat Springs is a great spot for it. We stayed in our hotel room until the last possible minute. We had a few hours to kill before our AirBnb was ready so the plan was to resupply at the grocery store nearby.

On the way to the store, we passed a community fishing pond. I stopped for some fishing while everyone else went to resupply. I didn’t catch anything, but I did get a few bites. If my rod could get the fly just a *little* bit further out I could have caught something. That’s where the fish were jumping.

After fishing I stopped by Taco Bell. Partly for food and partly to resupply my hot sauce packets. It was really crowded and they accidentally gave me 3 extra tacos!

After that, I bought groceries and went to the AirBnb. Caddyshack made an awesome lasagna for dinner and then we decided to go out. We were going to meet up with another group of hikers for karaoke night.

When we got there, it turned out to be some sort of karaoke competition and tonight was the finals. Unfortunately that meant no singing for us. The performances were all pretty good and the American idol style judging was funny.

After the competition, they sorta opened up the microphone and I was able to get a song in. It was pretty much just hikers left at the bar, but it was still fun.
