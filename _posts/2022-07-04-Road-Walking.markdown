As soon as I woke up, there were a bunch of mosquitoes waiting outside my tent. We’ve been pretty lucky with the bugs overall, but the last few days have been rough.

I got an early start this morning and did most of the day by myself. I started off on a forest road and actually watched some Netflix while I was hiking to pass the time.

I made it to the road really fast, but I met up with some other hikers that were meeting a friend for a ride to town. I ended up doing almost 4 extra miles because of where their friend was parked. Not great at the time, but I’m glad I don’t have to do it later.

The town of Steamboat is great for hikers. I got dropped off pretty far from downtown, but I was able to take a free bus to meet up with my friends. We’re taking the next two days off so we celebrated a little.

While walking to a brewery after lunch we got hit with another storm. This was the third time I was hailed on today. Part of me is looking forward to being out of these mountains so we don’t have to deal with this anymore.

For dinner we went to a burger place that I visited a couple years ago with Meghan. It was even better than I remembered.

Towns are always hectic. Everyone has different plans and needs. In Leadville, we planned to get here on the 5th, so when we got here a day early we needed somewhere to stay.

We found a decent rate at a hotel, which makes this a double zero. I don’t usually like taking days off but this is a great way to celebrate finishing Colorado. (Almost, there’s still a couple days of hiking. This is the last town in CO)
