After last night’s karaoke shenanigans, the goal of today was to relax. I spent most of my day sleeping in, eating food, and watching movies.

We did take a little trip around town and walked by the river. That was pretty nice. It was of course followed by a trip to the grocery store for more drinks and food.

Today was also my 3rd anniversary! I spent some time on the phone with Meghan and sent her some of her favorite cookies via Uber Eats. I’m sad I’m missing it this year, but we’ll see each other soon when I go back to Washington for her coworker’s wedding.
