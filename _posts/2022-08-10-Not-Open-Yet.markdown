The shuttle driver, Randy, told me he was heading up to the pass to pick up a hiker at 9 am. I wasn’t sure if I wanted to leave that early, but I was awake around 7 and figured I might as well hit the trail early.

Google said that one restaurant opened at 8 so I walked down to find out that it was still closed. The convenience store opened at 8:30 so I sat in front charging my phone until they opened.

As you can see, I got the breakfast of champions and ate it on the way up to the pass. The Pepsi was carbonated with nitrogen instead of carbon dioxide. Not really a winner.

I hit the trail with Poles. He was one of the only other nobos in town and he’s been hiking super fast. I think he passed me in Lima and then I caught up in Leadore.

The weather was a bit cloudy and rainy today. We had a few miles of sun but mostly clouds and at the end of the day, rain.

I hiked with Poles for almost the whole day and now we’re camped in the rain. We did 31 miles, which isn’t bad for a “late” start.

I had enough service today to check the weather and it looks like tomorrow should be nicer. I hope so, since hiking in the rain makes everything more complicated. Hopefully it helps any fires that might be burning in the area.
