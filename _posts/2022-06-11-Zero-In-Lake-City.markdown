Today was a pretty simple day. Beyond the normal resupply chores, all I needed to do was relax. 

First off was the post office. I decided to ship my ice axe and micro spikes ahead to the next town since they probably won’t be needed. If they still aren’t needed in the next section, the post office can simply send the package forward.

After the post office I stopped by the grocery store and got my food for the next few days of hiking. I also spent some time making phone calls to family and just enjoying doing nothing.

Since we had a kitchen, we made dinner at the cabin. We had pasta with elk meat from the grocery store. The water isn’t running so everything has been a little tricky.

After dinner we watched movies on TV and just hung around on our phones. Some of the neighbors showed up to hang out too.

Tomorrow we have a ride up to the trailhead and it will be time to get back to hiking.
