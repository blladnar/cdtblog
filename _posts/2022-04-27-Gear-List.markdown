In the five years since I hiked the PCT I've learned a lot about backpacking.
With that knowledge I've managed to shave almost 3 pounds off my base weight.
The biggest weight differences will be in my new sleeping bag, backpack, and tent.

This gear list should work for almost all of the trail, but I may need to add some
things as I get farther north. Most notably some snow gear for Colorado like an
ice axe and microspikes.

My puffy jacket and bear proof bag might be overkill for the start. I could save
a good amount of weight by switching the jacket for a fleece or upgrading to a
down jacket. I think I can justify it because it doubles as an amazing pillow, but
I'm still undecided on whether or not I'll upgrade to something lighter.

The bear bag is pretty heavy for a food bag and only really needed for Grizzly
country, but I mostly just want to avoid the hassle of having it sent out to me.
It also will provide better rodent protection than a regular stuff sack.

The sandals are pretty heavy for camp shoes, but I can hike in them and I've
really enjoyed them on other backpacking trips. They'll be wonderful for stops
in town as well.
