We started the day with a climb. Starting at over 11k and going to over 12 made it really hard.

That hard work paid off and the next few miles we’re a mostly snow free plateau with huge views and great hiking.

There was still some snow on the north facing slopes but crossing it wasn’t too bad.

The landscape was unlike anywhere I’ve been. There wasn’t much as far as plants and animals. Some birds and grasses were really all we could see.

We passed a few other hikers we had met in Chama that left the day before us. They were moving a little slower, but still enjoying the awesome trail.

As we traversed the mountains the views got better and better. Everything up there was incredible.

All good things must come to an end unfortunately. As we neared the road where we’d do our next resupply the trail dropped below the tree line.

The problem with hiking this early in the season is that the snow isn’t fully melted (especially in the trees) and nobody has done any trail maintenance. We had to deal with hundreds of fallen trees all over the trail which made the last few miles extremely slow and difficult.

Eventually we made it to this little ski patrol cabin at the top of Wolf Creek Ski Area. They leave it open for hikers to use.

We only have about 3 miles to the road tomorrow. If we wouldn’t have gotten to the cabin so late we would have gone into town. Instead we’ll enjoy the novelty of sleeping here and save some money on a hotel room.
