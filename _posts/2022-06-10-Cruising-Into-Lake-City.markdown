On the first day of the trail, Switch told me his grandpa had a cabin in Lake City, CO and if we were hiking together we could stay there. I thought there *no way* that would happen but guess what. It did.

There were 8 miles to go into town so I woke up early to get to the road. The hike went fast and we passed a few more hikers. Some new to us and some people we’ve met before.

Once at the road, we ran into some more hikers that were heading out. There were going to be a LOT of people in town.

As we waited for a ride, more hikers showed up. The more people waiting, the harder it usually is to get a ride. Luckily, a pickup truck pulled up and gave all of us a ride. The girls got to sit in the cab and the guys sat in the back.

There was a small (actually kinda big) hitch with the cabin. The water is still turned off from the winter. That means no laundry, no shower, and no bathrooms. Lucky for us the neighbors are really nice. Aggressively nice even. They’ve let us shower, do laundry, use the bathroom, and provided us with gallons of drinking water. They even let us use their side by side UTV to drive around town.

Since we had a cabin to ourselves, we even hosted a little thru hiker party. We had a few people over to play board games and hang out. It was a nice and relaxing night.
