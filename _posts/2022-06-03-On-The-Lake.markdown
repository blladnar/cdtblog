Another morning of sleeping in was nice before we had to hit the trail at 1 PM. We went to breakfast and I had some Pagosa Toast which was bread dipped in pancake batter and then cooked. It was a pretty interesting take on pancakes/toast.

After breakfast we packed up and visited the hot springs on the river. I mostly just soaked my feet and did a little fishing in the river.

There are a few free springs along the river and a few big resorts with really nice pools. I really want to come back here sometime with Meghan.

At 1 PM we met our new friend Bee God at the Pagosa Bakery. We grabbed some pastries and talked with him awhile before he took us back to the trail.

He’s a pretty awesome guy. Retired, with a pottery business and a honey business.

We had a bit of a late start, but managed to do about 10 miles to Archuleta Lake. We were early enough that I had some daylight to try and fish before cooking dinner.

There was a bunch of new hikers we hadn’t met before that are also camped at the lake. Now that we’ve jumped ahead, I suspect we’ll meet a lot of new people.

It’s about 70 more miles to Silverton and I think I have way more food than I need.
