Today was about getting ready for Colorado. I needed to go grocery shopping and pick up some packages with snow gear.

The post office was only open a couple hours today, so we showed up right when it opened. Meghan did a great job of packing up my ice axe and some other things.

She even wrote me this awesome note

After getting everything done we met up with other hikers in town and ate dinner outside.

The plan for tomorrow is to wake up and hitchhike to Cumbres Pass, which is only 20 miles away in Colorado. It’s just 3 miles from the New Mexico border, so we plan to hike back and touch the border.
