Just 21 miles to the Davila Ranch CDT rest stop. It apparently had laundry, showers, and unlimited eggs and potatoes. Of course we still had to get there.

On the way, we went up and over a mountain with an active fire lookout. I went up and had a chat with the Forest service worker that was manning it.

He lived up there in a small shed. He said there used to be a cabin, but a bear broke in and hibernated over the winter so they tore it down.

As always, it was sunny and hot, but I was still in good spirits.

I woke up early so I could get to the rest stop in the early afternoon. This would give me time to eat, shower, and do laundry. It was pretty bizarre to see washing machines and a refrigerator in the middle of the desert.

We have about 15 miles to go before our next town stop, a weird little place called Pie Town. Since we would get there after the restaurants closed, we decided to just stay here and enjoy the rest stop.

One unfortunate thing we learned in the past few days is that the forest service has closed most of the National Forests in New Mexico. That means the northern ~300 miles of trail here are closed. Not sure what that means for us yet, but thatâ€™s kinda how the CDT goes.
