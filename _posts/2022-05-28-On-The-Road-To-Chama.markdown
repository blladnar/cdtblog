Today was back to the Greyhound so we could go to Albuquerque and begin our way to Chama New Mexico where we will hitchhike to Cumbres Pass in Colorado and continue our hike.

Our first stop was an REI to pick up some new shoes and equipment for the still snow covered trail ahead. We arrived just before opening and there were a ton of people waiting outside.

In a stroke of good luck there was a Top Golf practically right next to REI. We had a few hours to kill before the next leg of our trip so we went to the range and hit some balls.

From here we needed to get to Santa Fe to pick up the free Blue Bus that would take us to Chama. There’s a cheap commuter train that goes to Santa Fe but it would get us there too late to make it to Chama tonight. I needed to be there on Saturday morning to pick up some things from the post office before it closed for Memorial Day weekend.

Google maps gave us the option of an airport shuttle that was about $33 a person. A Lyft was only $66 and we wouldn’t have to get to the airport.

So we took the longest Lyft of our lives and made it to Santa Fe. Again we had some time to kill so we went to see Meow Wolf, an interactive art installation.

The “House of Eternal Return” tells the story of a family that disappeared because they were messing with the multiverse. Different rooms of their house had portals to different dimensions.

It was incredibly well done and was a highlight of my trip so far.

After Meow Wolf, we got on a bus downtown and had dinner before getting on the Blue Bus.

This bus ride was pretty bizarre. The people that need to get out to these small towns were clearly going through some struggles. They were friendly and helpful to us, which made the experience a bit better.

We made it to Chama and met with lots of hikers we knew and a few that we didn’t. Colorado is gonna be crowded.
