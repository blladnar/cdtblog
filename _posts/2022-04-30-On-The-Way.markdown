Today I started my trip from Seattle to the southern terminus of the CDT. I’ll be taking the train all the way from Seattle to Los Angeles, then getting on another train to Lordsburg New Mexico. This will take something like 36 hours. From Lordsburg, I’ll get a shuttle to the Mexican border and start my hike.

After a fun going away party last night, Meghan dropped me off at the train station this morning. Just like on the PCT, saying goodbye might be the hardest part of the whole trip. At least this time she got to go back home where she has friends and family, instead of having to immediately move across the country and start grad school. I’m extremely lucky to have such a supportive wife and I’m going to miss her terribly. It’s a strange feeling to be so filled with excitement for my adventure, and sadness for leaving at the same time.

For the leg of the trip to LA I “splurged” and got a business class seat. It offers a little extra leg room and it’s right between the dining car and the lounge car.

Traveling by train has actually been pretty fantastic. The experience at the station was fast and easy. No security or waiting in line. If it didn’t take so long, I’d take the train way more.

While I was waiting for the train in the station an older guy asked me about my backpack and if I was going hiking. I told him my plans and he told me about his. He and his wife were on a trip to San Francisco, then to Chicago, then home to Spokane Washington. All by train!

It’s been rainy and cloudy all day, but the views have still been pretty great. At one point while I was in the lounge car I even saw a herd of elk grazing in a field. We passed through the mountains of southern Oregon somewhat near Crater Lake and I saw the trail where I crossed these same railroad tracks on the PCT.

My biggest surprise so far has been the food. Since we have a dining car I’ve been eating my meals in there. A couple hours before the meal a woman comes around and takes reservations. When my time comes I head up and get seated with some strangers. It’s been really fun meeting new people and seeing where they’re going. They usually seem pretty interested in where I’m heading too!

Early in the trip we had a 30-40 minute delay for a broken train signal. This was worrying because my layover in LA is only 50 minutes long. The next train to Lordsburg won’t get me there until after my shuttle is booked so I’d have to find another way. Luckily it looks like I can take a Greyhound from LA the next day, but I’d way rather just stay on the train.

Luckily, since then, we’ve mostly gotten back on the schedule. I’m not too confident in Amtrak’s ability to stay on time, but all I can do is go with the flow.
