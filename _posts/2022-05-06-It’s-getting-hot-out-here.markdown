Day 2 started early. The guys I’m hiking with woke up before 5 and I actually stayed in bed a little longer. I ended up getting on the trail just before 6. Hiking before it’s hot is important, but I’m not sure I need to hike in the dark yet.

The day went on with a bit more of the same. Cow pastures, cacti, and all kinds of spiky plants. There was a bit more climbing today, but nothing too major.

The only person we saw today was someone heading south to the monument. He told us about some trail magic under a big shade tree. There was a cooler full of Gatorade and the only shade for miles in each direction.

Once we got there we decided it was best to hang out for awhile. There was a water cache in addition to the Gatorade so we were able to drink our fill and wait out some of the heat. After a short siesta we headed on!

The last 10 or so miles of the day were done in short bursts between water and shade. Luckily we didn’t have to fight off the cows for this water. There was a hose just for us hikers.

We made it to camp before sunset and refilled our water at the cache. We’re pretty close to a road, but we’re over halfway back to Lordsburg.

My t-shirt seems to be made of salt now and my legs are incredibly dirty. I sacrificed a little water to at least get the salt crystals off my face.

I’m still getting used to my new gear. The tent is huge, but I’m bad at setting it up. My backpack is cool, but I don’t know where to store everything. I’ll get better at it. 

I had a little cell service today. I was able to let Meghan know I’m still here! Hopefully tomorrow it’ll be a little better and I can get everyone else updated on how this is going.
