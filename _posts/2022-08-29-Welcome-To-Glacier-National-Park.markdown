I thought I was camped outside the park last night but when I crossed the park boundary it turned out I was going, not coming. Whoops.￼

It was only about 7.5 miles to town and I got up a little early to make sure I could get breakfast. While I was hiking in I kept checking for cell phone service. Nothing. I walked into town and couldn’t figure out where to go. What do I do without the internet?

I saw a sign for a bakery so I started walking that way. Turns out that was the right way and I saw the hostel that other hikers had been raving about. There was also a restaurant next door. I dropped off my bag and went to get some food.

This was some of the best French toast I’ve ever had. After filling my stomach I could think a little straighter and I settled into the hostel. Around noon I walked into town and had a burger for lunch before buying my food for the next two days.

Other hikers started showing up in town and we all hung out eating and drinking. Hiker midnight (9 pm) rolled around and everything winded down. We still have 100 miles to go and I think it’s going to be a bit of a party for the next 4 days.

The “hostel” is an old restaurant and we can sleep on the floor, in our tent in the yard, or tent a private cabin. I opted for the floor tonight but when I finish I booked the cabin for two nights when Meghan is here. I’m excited for her to see this little slice of the hiker trash lifestyle.
