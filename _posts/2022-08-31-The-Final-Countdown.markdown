A 2000 foot climb to start the morning is usually pretty rough, but when it’s this beautiful, you don’t even notice the elevation. We started the day by climbing Triple Divide Pass. The pass is next to a peak that divides the 3 major watersheds of North America.

To my left is the Arctic, to my right is the Atlantic, and behind me is the Pacific. The way down was also really nice. We followed a river most of the way, crossing it on big suspension bridges.

These bridges are really wobbly they start shaking a lot when you walk in rhythm. They look cool though, and they definitely beat fording the river.

Since today was a shorter day than normal we all took a lot of breaks. There was some swimming in Red Eagle Lake and lots of snack breaks along the way. It’s nice to relax and slow down a bit to really enjoy the ending.

This is the crew that’s on my permit for finishing the trail. We’ll be camping together until the end. I really just met these guys but it’s been fun getting to know them as we get really close to the end.
