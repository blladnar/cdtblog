Today was a really hard day. I woke up at 5:30 and left by 6:00 because we needed to hike 21 miles to the next water source. I wanted to get as much of that out of the way while it was still cool.

Today also brought us back to the CDT. For the last week we’ve been on the Gila River alternate route but after our first mile of the day, we were back.

There was actually a fire in this section about a week ago and you could see the chemical they sprayed to put it out. All the rocks looked like they were painted red.

Today also had a ton of climbing and we got up to almost 10,000 feet. The view down the mountain was impressive.

There really isn’t a lot to report about today. I had to carry a ton of water and hike through the heat of the day.

That pond was our second water source for the day. It was pretty yellow and gross, so I only cooked with it since then it would be boiled as well as filtered.

Here’s a photo from near the end of the day. Funnily enough, we’re on another alternate route again.

Our next stop is Pie Town, NM and the official route involves walking 15 miles along a highway to get there. We opted for a route with forest roads the whole way. It also has a nice rest stop at a ranch that provides Wi-Fi, showers, laundry, and some food for hikers.

We should get there somewhat early tomorrow so we can relax a bit before heading into Pie Town the next morning.
