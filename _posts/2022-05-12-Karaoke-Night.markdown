After my big day yesterday i tried to sleep in. Unfortunately after a week of waking up at 5 am, I was only able to sleep until about 6:30. Part of that may have been my sore feet,

The hotel we’re staying in is apparently haunted. The legend goes that there was a murder and the ghost goes around knocking on doors. I haven’t heard anything too unusually, but I didn’t think someone knocked on my door…

After waking up too early, I went to a diner for breakfast, it was closed, so I walked to another one. When I walked in I noticed a table with 9 other hikers. I knew a couple so I wandered over and they invited me to sit down. I hadn’t met almost all of them, even the guy that started the PCT on the same day as me. (Small world.)

After food it was time for chores. Laundry was first. You’d think 3 people doing their laundry from the week would be a full load, but when it’s just a few t-shirts, the washer looks a little empty.

After that it was time for resupply food. I needed a couple days to the next stop and I needed to ship a package to the weird little community of Pie Town. The UPS website said they had something at a CVS, but it turned out to be just a pickup and drop off site. I needed to walk a mile to the UPS store…

As I was walking, I held my thumb out, hoping to get an easy ride. Within a couple minutes a truck pulled over. He actually waited for me to send my package and then drove me back home. People out here are great.

For dinner, we went back to the brewery. It’s a block away from the hotel and kinda the only bar in town. It just so happened to be Karaoke night. I sang one of my go to songs and it turned out great. Even had a dentist from Ohio tell me I was the highlight of his hike.

There were about a dozen hikers in the bar and only 4 of us sang a song. I was stoked to see my friend Tommy sing since he went to school for it. Unsurprisingly he crushed it. We hike out tomorrow and I can’t wait.
