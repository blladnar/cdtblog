I started this morning feeling a bit off. My pack was hurting my shoulders and it just felt like I was moving slow. I trudged along for a bit and stopped and did a little fishing. No luck.

There were lots of route choices today. Different alternates went up and over mountain passes or stuck to roads. I ended up taking a “high route” that stayed up on a pass and traversed across instead of dropping down a valley and coming back up. This ended up being way easier than the actual trail and still way cooler.

Just before this a sobo had told me I was close to another nobo. I think I must have passed them on my shortcut because I didn’t see them all day.

After the shortcut I went up high on a ridge and walked the divide for a lot of the day. There was no shade and it was very hot out. I think I might have even gotten sunburned, despite my deep deep base tan and the sun screen I put on!

My goal for the day was a lake about 34 miles ahead. Despite feeling slow today, my shortcut, and the awesome views on the ridge, got me to the lake before 8 pm. I had it to myself and played around with a cool echo by singing Row Row Row Your Boat. 

Not long after making dinner I heard what sounded like music. I think the nobo I passed must have made it to the lake too and they were singing! It sounded really cool. I’m pretty far away on the lake and my tent is blocked by a tree so I don’t think he knows I’m here.

It’s just 25 miles to town tomorrow. Should be easy right? My shoes and socks are so messed up and they’re messing with my feet. My new shoes should be waiting in town tomorrow and I had enough service earlier to find out Darn Tough was shipping me a new pair of socks to the next town. I hope they make it in time!
