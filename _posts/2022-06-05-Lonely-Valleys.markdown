The day started immediately with the dreaded “knife edge.” I’d be lying If I said I wasn’t a little nervous. I woke up before everyone and made it to the “knife edge” alone.

After turning the corner I could see the steep snow along the trail. Upon closer inspection, it wasn’t too bad. The consequences could have been high, but the risk was fairly low. I used my ice axe and micro spikes so it felt pretty easy.

I took off again and got way ahead of everyone. After I stopped for a break they all showed up. I kept on going.

The trail crossed a few valleys today, instead of the usual up and down of the ridges. Every time I would descend I would think how cool it was that I was the only person in this whole place.

Unfortunately, the trail today was very overgrown with this one type of bush.
Another hiker I passed was complaining about them and they were heavy for at least 15 miles past that.

The bushes had thick branches that would scrape your legs as you walked by. At the end of the day my legs were pretty trashed.

Finally, the trail descended into a huge meadow with multiple streams flowing into it.

I was the first one to the campsite so I took some time to try and fish before everyone showed up. I managed to catch a bush on the opposite side of the stream. I had to get in to unhook my line.

We’re getting very close to Silverton now. Maybe even tomorrow!
