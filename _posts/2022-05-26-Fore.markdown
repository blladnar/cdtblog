We kinda screwed up and didn’t buy our tickets to Albuquerque in time. So we’re going tomorrow at 6 am. That means we had a whole day off.

We headed out to get some breakfast and then took a bus to the local golf course. We had to rent clubs, but it was actually really fun.

I shot a 48 and the winner was Elliot with a 42. Not a bad day. I used a golf ball I found in silver city and carried the whole way. Unfortunately I lost it on the 9th and final hole.

When we got back to the hostel there was a whole crew there. Everyone we left at the toaster house (and more) had showed up.

Unfortunately we have to wake up early and get to the REI in Albuquerque, then the post office in Chama so we can hike out on Sunday.
