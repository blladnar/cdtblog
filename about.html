My name is Randall Brown and I'm a hiker/runner/programmer. Five years ago I
hiked the Pacific Crest Trail and this year I'm going to be tackling the
Continental Divide.

Since finishing the PCT I've gotten married, moved to New York (Poughkeepsie),
then back to Seattle, and survived a pandemic. Now it's time for my next big adventure.
I hope you enjoy following me along the way!
